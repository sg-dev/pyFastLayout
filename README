ParallelFR
==========

Goal: Parallel implementation of FR in a C-extension to python

quickstart guide
----------------
1) go to the folder 'fastlayout'
2) to build the module:
  $ python setup.py build
3) copy the .so file to the demo directory and change to it
  $ cp build/lib*/* ../demo
  $ cd ../demo
4) call the demo script ( igraph )
  $ python igraph.py
Alternative for graph-tool (unteseted)
  $ python graphtool.py
5) use 'layout_fr_stride_omp_simd()' if you just want the fastest version.
   otherwise have a look at 'fastlayout.h' for all function declarations and 'benchmark.py' for a comparison of all functions

Directory structure
-------------------

The current version of the extension is in folder 'fastlayout/'.
Specialized tags (converted from an older svn) can be found in 
the respective folders.

A documentation is locatated in the 'doc/' folder.

Demo scripts are in the 'demo/' folder together with examle input data. Be sure
to first build and copy the *.so file as described above.
